	 * INHERITANCE
	 * 
	 * ==> One of the 4 oop principles
	 * ==> 'extends' keyword is used to inherit from another class
	 * ==> 'is-a': relationship
	 * ==> sub class vs super class or child and parent
	 * ==> normally child class is more specific
	 * ==> access modifiers
	 * 
	 * 
	 * super is referring to direct parent class.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * this()==>represents current class's constructor.
	 * super()==>represents super/parent class's constructor.
	 * 
	 * Both must be used as a FIRST statement and can ONLY be used inside the constructor.
	 *
	 *
	 *this ---->represents an instance of e current class
	 *super---->represents an instance of a super class
	 *
	 * Static members are inherited as well as long as access modifier allows
	 * 
	 * static keyword does NOT have anything to do with access modifier
	 * 
	 * 
	 * =============================================================================
	 * 
	 * this vs super
	 * this() vs super()
	 * static vs instance initializer vs constructor
	 * --> Initializer blocks in java are used to give certain initial values to 
	 * instance variables and static variables. When we load class static block gets executed first
	 * then instance initializer and last constructor block gets executed. We use initializer blocks so
	 * we can properly give intial valuee, rather than giving hard coded values. 
	 * is static member inherited
