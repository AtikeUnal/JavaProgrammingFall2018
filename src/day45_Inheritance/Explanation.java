	 * INHERITANCE
	 * 
	 * -->When A java class uses/taking/getting/inheriting some other class's properties and methods this is called INHERITANCE.
	 *  **constractors can not be inherited.
	 * ==> Inheritance is one of the four OOP Principles.
	 * 
	 * 1.Encapsulation
	 * 2.Inheritance
	 * 3.Abstraction
	 * 4.Polymorphism
	 * 
	 * IS-A relationship=inheritance (synonim)
	 * 
	 * Syntax: we achieve inheritance using keyword 'extends'
	 *
	 * public class A{
		
		int name;
		public void m(0) {
			
		}
	}
	=============================================== 
		public class B extends A{
		
		}
	 * 
	 *  parent class and child class
	 *  ex: A is a parent class, B is a child.
	 *  
	 *  Why?: Reusability of class members, proper organization of source code.

	/**
	 * ACCESS MODIFIERS
	 * 
	 * 1.private--->protected for a class. Member is only accessible within the class.
	 * 2.default--->When we don't specify/put any acces modifier, it is called default access modifier. Package protected.
	 * 3.protected--->Package protected, unless there is parent-child relations.
	 * 4.public---> is public for any class within project
	 * 
	 * can be applied to variables, methods.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * ===========================================================================
	 * Default behavior constractor
	 * 1. If we dont have any constructor in a class compiler will automatically add default constructor
	 * 	if we have any constructor we dont get one 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2. First line of any constructor is a call to super class's no arg constructor by default super()
	 * 	Condition:If super(args) or this(args) not already used
