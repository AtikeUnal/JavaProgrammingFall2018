 * IS-A Relationship is Inheritance.
 * Child class/sub class IS-A Parent/Super class
 * 
 * A class that is implementing Interface IS-A Interface.
 * Ex:	Aeron is Rollable
 * 		Humanscale is Rollable and Collapsible.
 * 
 * A class implementing an interface IS-A interface. 
 * 
 * 		POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA
 * 
 * = Poly--> many
 * = Morphism--> forms, behaviors.
 * 
 * In Java polymorphism means One reference type having many forms.
 * 
 * 		REFERENCE TYPE VS OBJECT TYPE
 * 
 * Reference type
 * Object type
 * Static polimorphism
 * Dynamic polimorphism
 * Polymorphic arrays-Grouping specific types in collection
 * Casting--> being able to switch between the reference data types
 * 
 * 1.Downcasting---> is explicitly switching from parent datatype to child datatype using
 * 					 same reference. We must explicitly mention datatype when downcasting it in paranthesis.
 * 					 Ex: Food f=new Apple();
 * 						 Apple a=(Apple)f;  There are not two objects, there is only one object and two references.
 * 
 * 
 * 2.Upcasting ---> is covering from child class to parent class. We don't have explicitly mention datatype in
 * 					paranthesis, it happens by default/implicitly
