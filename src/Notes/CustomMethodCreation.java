	///CUSTOM METHOD CREATION IN JAVA
	
	//--> 1.VOID METHOD IN  JAVA
	// IF you have bunch of statements you want to run together you group them or you creat method to use it lately.
	//-so method is collection of statements.
	
	/*
	 * Logic:
	 * 1.purpose
	 * 		ex:charAt()--> giving us the char of a given index
	 * 			trim()--> getting rid of etxtra white spaces around the string.
	 * 2.naming 
	 * 		naming very important because you can reuse it or somebody can use it 
	 * 				you can name it as short version of the purpose
	 * 
	 * Rules:
	 * 1.method signature is --->(void myMethod(String name){
	 *  code here
	 * }
	 * -variable 'name' is local to printLastLetter method.
	 * -There is no WAY 'name' can go outside of this method.
	 * 
	 * 3.dependent information
	 * 
	 * ----------------------------------------------------
	 * public static void arrayStringSearch(String [] arr, String target  --these two are dependencies){
	 * }
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 *
