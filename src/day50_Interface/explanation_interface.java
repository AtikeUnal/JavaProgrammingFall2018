/**
 * it is not a class, it is interface
 * 
 * Provide set of abstract methods
 * A class implements an interface
 * 
 * METHODS: These form the objects interface with the outside world.
 * 			Keys on a keyboard are an interface with the computer.
 * 			Press the power button to turn the computer on or off. 
 * 			Most interfaces are group of relTED empty methdos.
 * 
 * Interface can have below members:
 * only constant field
 * abstract methods
 * default methods
 * Static methdos
 * 
 * Variables in interface :Always 'Public static final'
 * 
 * Methods in Interface
 * 	1.abstract methods-->By default 
 * 	2.default methods--->it is one way of having the regular method with the implementation in it
 * 	3.static methods-->it it also another way of having the regular method with the implementation . 
 * 	And it belongs to interface . We can call this method using interface name.
 * 
 *  When we implement Interface in concrete class we MUST implement all unimplemented methods that are inherited.
 *  Interface cannot implement another Interface but interface can extend to another interface. Alse multiple
 *  inheritance is allowed.
